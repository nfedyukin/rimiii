Let’s start simple: choose a theme that already provides a blog page template. For example Antimatter, TwentyFifteen, Deliver, Lingonberry, Afterburner2, and many others. How do you check if your theme already provides a blog page template? Go in the /user/themes/[yourtheme]/templates folder, and check the existence of the blog.html.twig and item.html.twig files.

If you’ve already chosen a theme, and your theme does not come with those files, then copy them from Antimatter: https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-antimatter/tree/develop/templates

You might need to tweak the markup to suit your theme. The best option if you’re just starting out if to use a theme that already comes with them.
